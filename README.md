# ORM vs Optimized SQL üöÄ

**Why trusting your ORM blindly can kill performance ‚Äì Spring Boot + PostgreSQL demo.**

This repository demonstrates how **na√Øve ORM queries** (Hibernate/JPA) can lead to severe performance issues, and how **optimized SQL queries** can drastically improve execution times.  

The goal is to show developers and architects why it‚Äôs essential to understand **how ORMs generate queries**, and to highlight the importance of **query optimization** when building scalable systems.

## üîé Context
In many enterprise systems, ORMs like Hibernate are used without considering the SQL they generate.  
This can cause:
- Unnecessary joins
- Cartesian products
- Inefficient filtering
- Missing indexes  

In real-world projects, I‚Äôve seen operations go from **minutes down to milliseconds** just by rewriting queries and optimizing database access.

## üìä Benchmark Results

### A. Resumen mensual por cuenta
| Scenario                  | Execution Time (s) | Query Count |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| ORM na√Øve without indices | 45,29              | 83827       |
| ORM na√Øve with indices    | 43,95              | 83827       |
| ORM optimized             | 0,061              | 2           |
| SQL pure                  | 0,074              | 1           |

*Note:* This scenario summarizes monthly data by account. It highlights the performance impact of different query strategies on aggregating large datasets without and with indexing, as well as optimized ORM and pure SQL approaches.

### B. Top counterparties del mes
| Scenario                  | Execution Time (s) | Query Count |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| ORM na√Øve without indices | 45,58              | 83827       |
| ORM na√Øve with indices    | 42,72              | 83827       |
| ORM optimized             | 0,091              | 2           |
| SQL pure                  | 0,068              | 1           |

*Note:* This scenario identifies the top counterparties for the month. It demonstrates how indexing and query optimization affect performance in queries involving sorting and filtering by counterparties.

### C. Detalle auditable paginado (+ tags)
| Scenario                  | Execution Time (s) | Query Count |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| ORM na√Øve without indices | 0,36               | 761         |
| ORM na√Øve with indices    | 0,35               | 761         |
| ORM optimized             | 0,034              | 4           |
| SQL pure                  | 0,009              | 2           |

*Note:* This scenario provides an auditable, paginated detail view including tags. It showcases the impact of pagination, batch fetching, and optimized fetching strategies on query efficiency.

### D. Consolidado mensual (por cuenta + por moneda)
| Scenario                  | Execution Time (s) | Query Count |
|---------------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| ORM na√Øve without indices | 45,23              | 83827       |
| ORM na√Øve with indices    | 42,67              | 83827       |
| ORM optimized             | 0,061              | 2           |
| SQL pure                  | 0,053              | 1           |

*Note:* This scenario consolidates monthly data by account and currency. It highlights the benefits of hand-crafted SQL queries with indexes and window functions to achieve the best performance.

## üìã Demo Description
This demo simulates a real-world financial transaction collector used to prepare foreign exchange declarations. It includes multiple entities such as CompanyAccount, DestinationAccount, Movement, Currency, ExchangeRate, FxDeclaration, and others. These entities are connected through various relationship types including one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many, and one-to-one. The demo illustrates how careless use of ORM mappings in such complex relational models can lead to significant performance problems, including N+1 queries, Cartesian products, heavy fetch joins, and missing indexes. The project then contrasts these issues with optimized approaches using native SQL queries, proper indexing, batch fetching, projections, and window functions to improve performance dramatically.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
- **Hibernate (JPA)**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Docker** (for DB setup)
- **JUnit** (for simple benchmarks)

## üìå Scenarios
1. **Unoptimized ORM query** ‚Äì Using default JPA/Hibernate mapping carelessly, highlighting N+1 issues, heavy fetch joins, etc.  
2. **Optimized ORM query** ‚Äì Leveraging framework features (e.g., projections, fetch strategies, batch size, indexes) to make ORM queries more efficient.  
3. **Optimized native SQL** ‚Äì Using hand-crafted SQL queries, indexes, and database-level tuning.  

This structure shows that ORMs are valuable when used consciously and optimized, and that the comparison is fair against optimized SQL.

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/orm-vs-optimized-sql.git
cd orm-vs-optimized-sql
```

2. Start PostgreSQL using `docker-compose` (recommended):
```bash
docker compose up -d
# or, if your environment uses the old syntax:
# docker-compose up -d
```
This will start PostgreSQL with database `performance_demo`, user `postgres`, password `postgres`, on port 5432.

3. Update application.yml with your DB credentials.
4. Run the Spring Boot application:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
